## About

The following repository contains the source code of the official website of Career Development and Corporate Relations Center, IIT Ropar.

## Development setup without Docker
Before proceeding further, ensure that you have `python3` and `PostgreSQL` installed on your computer! In case you don't, you can download python3 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repo and change the directory.
2. Now install all dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> The root directory should have a file named `.env.example`. Before proceeding to the next step, you must make a .env file and fill in all the values mentioned. Alternately, you may add all these values in your `.bashrc` script too.
3. Change the directory into `src/`.
```bash
cd src/
```
4. Now, run the following command to make migrations corresponding to the models in the project.
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
5. Migrate the changes into the database.
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
6. Now, run the development server with the following command.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
7. Congrats! Now you are all set to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰


## Development setup with Docker
The development setup with `docker` is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is put proper values in the `.env` file. It will automatically make a db admin in the postgres database based on the values in the `.env` file.


1. After cloning the repo, run the following command to build the container and mount appropriate volumes.
```bash
docker-compose build
```
2. Now start the containers with the following command.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
> It will start the backend server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
3. You may use the following command to stop the containers.
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Production Deployment using Docker
Here too, with `docker`, things are fairly straightforward. Before moving futher,ensure that you have put appropriate values in the `.env` file.

1. After cloning the repo, run the following command to build the container and mount appropriate volumes.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
```
2. Now start the containers with the following command.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
> It will start the backend server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
3. You may use the following command to stop the containers.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

## Continuous Integration Logic

Here a pictorial overview of the continuous integration. Please note that the team doesn't have `ssh` access to the system. Suggestions are welcome to improve the existing design.

### Scripts

These are the following scripts which are used in the `prod`.
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Script Name</b></td>
        <td><b>Function(s)</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="./startup.sh">startup.sh</a>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>startup.sh is responsible for making migrations files corresponding to the models and then apply them to the database.</li>
                <li>It also collects the static assets and pushes them into the mounted docker volume.</li>
                <li>At last, it creates the superuser using the specified environment variables if there isn't any. </li>
                <li>Ensure that all the containers are running before using this script.</li>
                <li>Ideally, we should run this just after we run the containers. And we should run it once per deployment.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <a href="./prod/main.sh">prod/main.sh</a>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>main.sh is responsible for checking if the COMMIT ID of the remote repo changed. If yes, it clones the repository, builds it and starts the application.</li>
                <li>It calls to startup.sh in the end</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
