                    eligible and suitable to their job specifications. You can refer to the placement procedure&nbsp;<a

                    hours. If you wish to travel by air, the nearest airport is NetajiSubhash Chandra Bose International
                    Airport, Chandigarh. From there you can take a taxi and reach the campus in 2 Â½ hours. For further

                <p>
                    A company can only hold its PPT once it has filled in the Job Notification Form. A Pre Placement
                    Session is typically scheduled for 1 hour. A student coordinator will be in touch with you regarding
                    the formalities once other requirements have been met.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What facilities are available for accommodation on campus ?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We offer rooms on campus at the Technology Guest House on a twin sharing basis. A Student
                    Coordinator will be in touch with you after prior formalities related to the program have been
                    completed.</p>

                        offers resolved ?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Yes, there are multiple companies recruiting in each slot. The job offers of each particular slot
                    are announced at the end of the slot and each candidate is required to confirm his choice by 10 AM
                    the next day.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Can a candidate who has already been placed sit the interviews of another company ?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    IIT Ropar strictly follows a&nbsp;One Student, One Job&nbsp;policy wherein, once a job has been
                    accepted by the student he will not be eligible for any other company thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What sort of infrastructure is available on the campus for the placement process ?</strong>
